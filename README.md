# Deep Learning Techniques applied to the estimation of uniformity coefficient in sprinkler irrigation systems 

This repository contains the code developed for the dissertation that was presented as a partial requirement to obtain a Master's Degree in Computational Technologies for Agribusiness in the Technological University of Parana.


## ðŸ›  Technological Stack

**Front-end:** Plotly Dash

**Back-end:** Plotly Express

**Models:** In this work, a fully connected neural network was developed using jupyter notebooks, keras and scikit-learn. A bayesian hyperparameter optimization was employed to find the optimal model configuration.

## ðŸš€ About Me
Currently, I'm a PhD student in the Graduate Program of Computer Science of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). I'm also a scholarship holder in the Ceos project, a partnership between UFSC and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Santa Catarina (MPSC) with the aim of researching and creating data science workflows that can improve decision making related to the MPSC's internal activities.

My research interests involve the use and development of new machine learning and data science methodologies to improve the detection of fraudulent behavior in government procurement.
